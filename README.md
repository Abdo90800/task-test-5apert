🧠 How I Used AI Tools
🤖 How I Used AI Tools
To enhance productivity and ensure quality, I used the following tools:

💜 Lovable AI: for managing and presenting the final version of the task visually.

💡 Grok (Cursor): to scaffold components (DoctorCard, Modal, AppointmentList), generate mock data, review accessibility, and generate test cases.

🧑‍💻 VS Code: as my main IDE for development and live previews.


I used Cursor to:

Scaffold components (DoctorCard, Modal, AppointmentList)

Generate mock doctor data

Review accessibility and suggest ARIA improvements

Generate test cases and improve code quality

📌 Accessibility Features
All elements accessible via keyboard (Tab, Enter, Esc)

Proper use of aria-label, role, aria-describedby

Dialogs use role="dialog" and trap focus

Passed checks using Lighthouse & axe DevTools

📎 Known Limitations / Next Steps
Data is fully mocked (no backend integration)

No form validation for appointment selection (basic flow only)

Can be extended with:

Calendar picker

Notification system (toast on success)

Backend integration via API
